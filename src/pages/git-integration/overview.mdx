# Git Integration Overview

At lomi., we understand the importance of collaboration and versioning when it comes to your payment integration setup. While the lomi. platform itself is not version-controlled, we strongly recommend using version control systems like Git to manage your integration code and configurations.

Git allows you to:
- Track changes to your codebase
- Collaborate with your team members
- Maintain a history of your integration setup
- Easily revert to previous versions if needed

In the following sections, we'll cover best practices, branching strategies, code reviews, and versioning for effectively managing your lomi. integration using Git.
