# Working with BigInt

When your response data contains `BigInt`, the parsed value may become corrupted because lomi. parses the response data by default, which can lead to a loss of fidelity.
This occurs because `JSON.parse()` does not handle `BigInt` values correctly by default.

However, if you need access to the raw response data (for example, if it contains `BigInt`), you can bypass the parsing step.

To prevent automatic parsing and work directly with the raw response data, add the below expression to the `pre-request` script.

```js
req.disableParsingResponseJson();
```
