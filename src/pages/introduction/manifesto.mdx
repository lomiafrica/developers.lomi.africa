# Manifesto

The time has come to transform payment processing across Africa.

We believe that accepting payments shouldn't be complex, regardless of where you operate or what payment methods your customers prefer. The fragmented payment landscape in Africa creates unnecessary barriers for businesses trying to grow.

lomi. addresses these challenges with a unified, open approach to payment orchestration. We believe that:

- **Payment Processing Should Be Simple**: One integration to accept all payment methods
- **Security Is Non-Negotiable**: Every transaction is protected with industry-leading security measures
- **Innovation Should Be Accessible**: Advanced features like fraud detection and analytics are available to all businesses
- **Integration Should Be Seamless**: Adding new payment methods is straightforward and hassle-free
- **Compliance Is Built-In**: Meeting regulatory requirements is part of our platform's foundation

We envision an Africa where any business can easily accept payments from their customers, using any payment method, without worrying about the complexity behind the scenes. No more stories of *"We can't expand to that market because integrating their payment systems is too complex."*

Join us in our mission to simplify payment processing across Africa. Experience the future of unified, secure, and efficient payment processing with lomi.
