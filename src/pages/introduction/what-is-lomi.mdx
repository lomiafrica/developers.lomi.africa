# What is lomi.?

lomi. is a unified, open-source payment orchestration platform built to transform payment processing across West Africa. We seamlessly integrate multiple payment providers and methods while providing a comprehensive set of products for merchants.

Our platform empowers businesses to focus on growth without worrying about the challenges of payment processing.

We aim to solve two core challenges:

### **Payment Complexity**

The West African payment landscape is fragmented, with numerous payment providers, methods, and regulatory requirements. This complexity often forces merchants to manage multiple integrations, leading to increased development costs, maintenance overhead, and technical debt.

lomi. solves this by providing:

- **Unified Integration**: One integration for all your preferred payment channels (Credit cards, MTN Momo, Wave, Orange Money — and counting!)
- **Customizable Checkout**: Highly customizable, seamless checkout experiences to boost conversion
- **Enterprise grade Analytics**: Gain valuable insights through detailed transaction reporting
- **Simple Reconciliation**: Simple reconciliation and refunds processes
- **Powerful Dashboard**: Powerful dashboard for business management

### **Security and Compliance**

Merchants need robust security measures and compliance frameworks, but implementing these without compromising user experience or increasing operational complexity is challenging, especially in the West African context.

lomi. addresses this through:

- **Advanced Security**:
  - Industry-leading fraud detection and prevention
  - Secure tokenization and PCI-compliant data storage
  - Real-time transaction monitoring
  
- **Built-in Compliance**:
  - Licensed payment service provider from the BCEAO (Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest)
  - Comprehensive audit trails and logs
  - Regular security updates and compliance monitoring

The platform is designed with security-first principles, ensuring that both merchants and their customers can transact with confidence.
