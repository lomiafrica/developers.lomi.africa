# **Authentication**

All lomi. requests are authentified using API keys. Any request that doesn't include a valid API key will return an authentication error.

There are two types of API keys corresponding to lomi.'s two environments: Test and Live.

## **API keys**

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Requests made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

You must include an API key in the `` `X-API-Key` `` header for every request.

```http filename="API request header"
GET /v1/providers HTTP/1.1
Host: api.lomi.africa
X-API-Key: your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with your specific secret API key.

## **Test vs. Live environments**

lomi. provides two distinct environments to separate development and testing from production operations.

### **Test environment**

Use the test environment to develop and test your integration without processing real transactions or affecting live data. It mirrors the functionality of the live environment.

-   **API Keys:** Test API keys start with `` `lomi_sk_test_` ``.
-   **Base URL:** `` `https://sandbox.api.lomi.africa/v1` ``
-   **Rate Limits:** 120 requests per minute / 20,000 requests per day.
-   **Data:** Uses simulated data. Responses may include environment flags like `` `"environment": "test"` ``.

### **Live environment**

Use the live environment for production operations involving real transactions.

-   **API Keys:** Live API keys start with `` `lomi_sk_live_` ``.
-   **Base URL:** `` `https://api.lomi.africa/v1` ``
-   **Rate Limits:** 60 requests per minute / 10,000 requests per day.
-   **Data:** Processes real data. Responses may include environment flags like `` `"environment": "live"` ``.

To switch between environments, simply use the appropriate API key and base URL.

## **Obtaining API keys**

You can obtain your API keys after signing up and completing verification:

1.  Log in to the [dashboard](https://lomi.africa/portal).
2.  Navigate to the **Developers** or **API Settings** section.
3.  Generate separate API keys for the **Test** and **Live** environments.

## **Key management and security**

Treat your API keys as sensitive credentials. You can manage them (generate, revoke, view usage) in the merchant dashboard.

**Best practices:**

-   **Keep keys confidential:** Do not share your secret keys. Store them securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets management service).
-   **Never expose keys client-side:** Do not embed API keys in frontend code.
-   **Avoid version control:** Do not commit keys to your codebase.
-   **Use test keys for development:** Only use live keys for production applications.
-   **Rotate keys:** Consider rotating keys periodically or if you suspect a compromise.
-   **Limit access:** Restrict access to API keys within your organization.
