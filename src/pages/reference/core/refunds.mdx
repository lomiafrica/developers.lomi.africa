# **Refunds (Beta)**

**(Note: This API is currently in Beta)**

The Refunds API allows you to retrieve details about refunds processed for transactions associated with your merchant account.

*(Currently, creating refunds via the API is not supported; refunds are typically initiated through the merchant dashboard or other internal mechanisms.)*

## **Authentication**

Requests require authentication using your API key in the `` `X-API-Key` `` header. See the [Authentication](./authentication) guide.

## **The refund object**

Represents a refund issued for a specific transaction. See [Data Models](./data-models#refund-object) for the full structure (Note: This link assumes the object will be added to data-models.mdx).

## **Endpoints**

### **Get refund details**

**Endpoint:** `` `GET /refunds/{id}` ``

## **Error handling**

Common errors include `` `400 Bad Request` `` for an invalid refund ID format, `` `401 Unauthorized` ``, `` `404 Not Found` `` if the refund ID doesn't exist or belong to the merchant, and `` `500 Internal Server Error` ``. Refer to the [Errors](./errors) guide for general structure and handling.
