# **Error handling**

We use conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:

-   Codes in the `` `2xx` `` range indicate success.
-   Codes in the `` `4xx` `` range indicate a client-side error (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid data was sent, etc.).
-   Codes in the `` `5xx` `` range indicate an error with our servers (these are rare), in case of doubt you can visit our [status page](https://status.lomi.africa).

When an API request fails (returns a `` `4xx` `` or `` `5xx` `` status code), the response body will contain a JSON object detailing the error.

## **Error response structure**

All error responses follow a consistent JSON format:

```json filename="Example of an error response"
{
  "error": {
    "message": "A human-readable description of the error.",
    "details": "Optional: Additional details or structured information about the error."
  }
}
```

| Property    | Type                   | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `` `error` ``     | `` `object` ``                 | Container for the error information.                           |
| `` `message` ``   | `` `string` ``                 | A brief, human-readable summary of the error.                  |
| `` `details` ``   | `` `string` `` or `` `object` ``       | Optional. Provides more specific context or structured data about the error (e.g., validation failures, conflicting resources). |

## **HTTP status codes**

Here are some common HTTP status codes you might encounter:

| Code | Status                  | Meaning                                                                                     |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `` `200` ``  | OK                      | The request was successful.                                                                 |
| `` `201` ``  | Created                 | The request was successful and a resource was created (e.g., creating a webhook).         |
| `` `204` ``  | No Content              | The request was successful but there is no representation to return (e.g., deleting a webhook). |
| `` `400` ``  | Bad Request             | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter or invalid data format. |
| `` `401` ``  | Unauthorized            | No valid API key provided.                                                                  |
| `` `403` ``  | Forbidden               | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.                                |
| `` `404` ``  | Not Found               | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                                       |
| `` `409` ``  | Conflict                | The request conflicts with the current state of the resource (e.g., duplicate webhook URL). |
| `` `429` ``  | Too Many Requests       | Rate limits have been exceeded.                                                             |
| `` `500` ``  | Internal Server Error   | Something went wrong on lomi's end (these are rare).                                        |
| `` `503` ``  | Service Unavailable     | We're temporarily offline for maintenance. Please try again later.                           |

## **Common error messages**

While the specific `` `message` `` and `` `details` `` will vary, here are examples associated with common status codes:

**`` `400` `` Bad Request:**

-   `"message": "Invalid request"`, `"details": "Missing required field: \`url\`"`
-   `"message": "Invalid request"`, `"details": "Invalid \`Webhook ID\` format."`
-   `"message": "Invalid request body"`

**`` `401` `` Unauthorized:**

-   `"message": "Invalid API key"`, `"details": "The provided API key is invalid or does not exist"`
-   `"message": "Missing API key"`, `"details": "API key is required for authentication"`
-   `"message": "Authentication required"`

**`` `404` `` Not Found:**

-   `"message": "Webhook not found"`, `"details": "Webhook with ID \`wh_...\` does not exist or does not belong to this organization."`
-   `"message": "Resource not found"`

**`` `409` `` Conflict:**

-   `"message": "Conflict"`, `"details": "A webhook with this URL already exists for your organization."`

**`` `429` `` Too Many Requests:**

-   `"message": "Rate limit exceeded"`

**`` `500` `` Internal Server Error:**

-   `"message": "Internal server error"`
-   `"message": "Database error"`, `"details": "Failed to execute database query."`

## **Handling errors**

Your integration should gracefully handle potential API errors:

1.  **Check the HTTP Status Code:** Determine the general outcome of the request.
2.  **Parse the Response Body:** If the status code indicates an error (`` `4xx` `` or `` `5xx` ``), parse the JSON response body.
3.  **Use Error Information:** Use the `` `message` `` and `` `details` `` from the parsed JSON to understand the specific problem.
4.  **Implement Logic:** Based on the error type, implement appropriate logic (e.g., prompt the user to fix input for a `` `400` `` error, check credentials for `` `401` ``, retry later for `` `429` `` or `` `5xx` `` errors).
5.  **Log Errors:** Log errors, including the full response body and potentially the request ID (if provided in headers), to aid debugging.
