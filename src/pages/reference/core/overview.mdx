# **API overview**

Welcome to the lomi.'s REST API documentation. This API allows you to integrate lomi.'s payment capabilities directly into your applications.

You can use the API to manage resources like payment providers and configure webhooks to receive real-time event notifications.

## **Environments and authentication**

lomi. provides separate **Test** and **Live** environments, each with its own base URL and API keys. All API requests must be authenticated using your secret API key passed in the `` `X-API-Key` `` header.

For full details on environments, base URLs, obtaining API keys, and security best practices, see the [Authentication](./authentication) guide.

## **Requests and responses**

All API requests should be made over HTTPS to the appropriate base URL. Request bodies (for `` `POST` ``, `` `PATCH` `` methods) should be sent as JSON.

Responses are returned in JSON format. Successful requests return `` `2xx` `` status codes. Failed requests return `` `4xx` `` or `` `5xx` `` status codes with a standardized error object in the response body.

Learn more about the structure of success and error responses in the [Errors](./errors) guide.
