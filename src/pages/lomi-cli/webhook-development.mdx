# Webhook Development

The lomi. CLI provides tools to help you manage webhook endpoints for your integration.

## Registering Webhooks

Use the `webhook register` command to set up a new webhook endpoint:

```bash copy
lomi webhook register
```

The command will prompt you for:
- Your merchant ID
- The webhook URL
- Events to subscribe to

Example events include:
- `payment.success`
- `payment.failed`
- `payment.pending`
- `refund.success`
- `refund.failed`

## Managing Webhooks

List your registered webhook endpoints:

```bash copy
lomi webhook list --merchant-id your_merchant_id
```

This shows:
- Webhook ID
- URL
- Subscribed events
- Active status
- Last triggered timestamp

## Security

When a webhook is registered, you'll receive a verification token. Store this securely - you'll need it to verify webhook signatures.

## Local Development

The CLI includes a development server for testing webhooks locally:

```bash copy
lomi dev --port 3000
```

This starts a server that:
- Listens for incoming webhook events
- Displays webhook headers and payload
- Shows verification tokens
- Logs all requests for debugging

The server will print detailed information about each received webhook, making it easy to debug your integration.

## Development Setup

1. Create a webhook endpoint in your application that can receive POST requests

2. Register the webhook using the CLI:
```bash copy
lomi webhook register
```

3. Use the verification token to validate incoming webhooks:
```typescript
import crypto from 'crypto';

function verifyWebhookSignature(
  payload: string,
  signature: string,
  secret: string
): boolean {
  const hmac = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  return hmac === signature;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify signatures**
   - Use the verification token to validate webhook authenticity
   - Reject requests with invalid signatures

2. **Handle retries**
   - Implement idempotency using the event ID
   - Return 2xx status for successful processing
   - Return 5xx status for retryable errors

3. **Monitor webhook health**
   - Track successful and failed deliveries
   - Set up alerts for repeated failures
