# Variables

Variables in lomi. allow you to store and manage dynamic values that can be used across your payment integration setup. This feature enhances flexibility, maintainability, and security by enabling you to manage frequently changing or sensitive data, such as API keys, environment-specific URLs, or webhook secrets, in a centralized manner.

lomi. supports different types of variables to cater to various use cases:

- [Environment Variables](./environment-variables): Store values that differ between environments, such as test and production URLs or credentials.
- [API Keys](./api-keys): Manage your API keys securely and use them in your integration setup.
- [Webhook Secrets](./webhook-secrets): Store and manage secrets used to secure your webhook endpoints.

By leveraging variables, you can keep your integration setup clean, maintainable, and secure, while easily adapting to different environments or configurations.
