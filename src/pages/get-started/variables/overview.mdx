# Variables

Variables in lomi. allow you to store and manage dynamic values that can be used across your payment integration setup. This feature enhances flexibility, maintainability, and security by enabling you to manage sensitive data, such as API keys, in a centralized manner.

lomi. supports the use of variables, specifically API keys, to authenticate and secure your integration with the lomi. API.

- [API Keys](./api-keys): Manage your API keys securely and use them to authenticate your requests to the lomi. API.

By leveraging variables, you can keep your integration setup clean, maintainable, and secure, while easily managing your API credentials.
