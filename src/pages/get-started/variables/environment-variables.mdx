# Environment Variables

Environment variables in lomi. allow you to store values that differ between environments, such as test and production URLs or credentials. This enables you to easily switch between different environments without modifying your integration code.

## Creating Environment Variables

To create an environment variable:

1. Log in to your lomi. account and navigate to the "Settings" page.
2. Click on the "Environment Variables" tab.
3. Click the "Add Variable" button.
4. Enter a name for your variable and its value for each environment (e.g., test and production).
5. Save your changes.

## Using Environment Variables

You can reference environment variables in your integration setup using the `{{ENV_VAR_NAME}}` syntax. For example, if you have an environment variable named `API_BASE_URL`, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
const apiUrl = '{{API_BASE_URL}}/payments';
```

When your integration runs, lomi. will replace the variable placeholder with the actual value corresponding to the current environment.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for your environment variables to make their purpose clear.
- Keep sensitive information, such as API keys or secrets, in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your integration code.
- Regularly review and update your environment variables to ensure they are up-to-date and secure.

By using environment variables, you can make your integration setup more flexible and maintainable, while keeping sensitive data secure.
