# Setting Up Payment Methods

After creating your merchant account, the next step is to set up the payment methods you want to offer to your customers.

1. Log in to your lomi. dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Payment Methods" section.
3. Click on the "Add Payment Method" button.
4. Select the payment method you want to add (e.g., credit card, mobile money, etc.).
5. Follow the instructions to provide the necessary details and credentials for the selected payment method.
6. Save your changes.

Repeat these steps for each payment method you want to support. lomi. will handle the integration with the respective payment providers.
