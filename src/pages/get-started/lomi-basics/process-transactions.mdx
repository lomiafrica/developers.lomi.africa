# Processing Transactions

With lomi. integrated into your application or website, you can start processing transactions.

1. When a customer initiates a payment on your website or app, send a payment request to lomi. using the appropriate API endpoint or SDK method.

2. lomi. will handle the payment flow, securely collecting the customer's payment details and processing the transaction through the selected payment method.

3. You will receive a response indicating the status of the transaction (success, failure, or pending).

4. Use webhooks to receive real-time notifications about transaction updates and status changes.

5. Manage and track your transactions through the lomi. dashboard, which provides detailed reporting and analytics.

lomi. ensures secure and reliable payment processing, with built-in fraud detection and PCI DSS compliance.

For more information on transaction processing and best practices, refer to the [Transaction Processing Guide](../transactions/overview). Please note that you can also use lomi. in a Low-code and No-code set-up.
