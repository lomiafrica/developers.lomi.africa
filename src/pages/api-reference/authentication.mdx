# Authentication

The lomi.africa API uses API keys for authentication. All API requests must include your API key in the headers.

## API Keys

Your API key should be included in the `X-API-KEY` header of all requests:

```bash
X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lomi.africa/v1/merchants/123" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```typescript
import { LomiClient } from '@lomi/sdk';

const lomi = new LomiClient({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key_here'
});
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Keys Secure**
   - Never expose API keys in client-side code
   - Don't commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables to store keys

2. **Key Rotation**
   - Rotate keys periodically
   - Immediately rotate compromised keys
   - Use different keys for development and production

3. **Access Control**
   - Use test keys for development
   - Limit key access to necessary team members
   - Monitor key usage regularly

## Test vs Production Keys

- **Test Keys**: Start with `test_` prefix
  - Use for development and testing
  - No real transactions processed
  - Test provider integrations available

- **Production Keys**: Start with `live_` prefix
  - Use for real transactions
  - Actual money movement
  - Real provider integrations
