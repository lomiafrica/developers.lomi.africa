# Subscriptions

Manage recurring payments and subscriptions for your business with lomi.'s subscription system. Our subscription API allows you to create and manage subscription plans, handle billing cycles, and process recurring payments automatically.

## Creating Subscription Plans

Create flexible subscription plans that match your business model:

```typescript
const plan = await lomi.subscriptionPlans.create({
  name: "Premium Plan",
  amount: 5000, // Amount in XOF
  interval: "month",
  currency: "XOF",
  description: "Premium access to all features"
});
```

### Supported Intervals
- `day` - Daily billing
- `week` - Weekly billing
- `month` - Monthly billing
- `year` - Yearly billing

## Managing Subscriptions

### Create a Subscription

```typescript
const subscription = await lomi.subscriptions.create({
  customer: "cus_123456789",
  plan: "plan_987654321",
  payment_method: "pm_123456789",
  start_date: "2024-02-20"
});
```

### Update a Subscription

```typescript
const subscription = await lomi.subscriptions.update("sub_123456789", {
  plan: "plan_new_987654321",
  prorate: true
});
```

### Cancel a Subscription

```typescript
const subscription = await lomi.subscriptions.cancel("sub_123456789", {
  at_period_end: true // Cancel at the end of the billing period
});
```

## Billing Cycles

Subscriptions are billed automatically based on the plan's interval:

1. The first payment is processed immediately
2. Subsequent payments are processed on the renewal date
3. Failed payments are retried according to your retry settings

### Retry Schedule
- First retry: 3 days after failure
- Second retry: 5 days after first retry
- Final retry: 7 days after second retry

## Usage-Based Billing

Track and bill for usage within a subscription period:

```typescript
await lomi.subscriptionItems.createUsageRecord("si_123456789", {
  quantity: 100,
  timestamp: "2024-02-20",
  action: "increment"
});
```

## Subscription Lifecycle

1. **Active**: Subscription is active and billing normally
2. **Past Due**: Payment has failed but retries are ongoing
3. **Canceled**: Subscription has been canceled
4. **Unpaid**: All payment retries have failed

## Customer Portal

Let customers manage their own subscriptions through our hosted Customer Portal:

```typescript
const session = await lomi.billingPortal.sessions.create({
  customer: "cus_123456789",
  return_url: "https://your-site.com/account"
});
```

## Subscription Analytics

Track subscription metrics in your Dashboard:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Customer Churn Rate
- Revenue Churn Rate
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

## Webhooks

Subscribe to subscription-related webhook events:
- `subscription.created`
- `subscription.updated`
- `subscription.deleted`
- `subscription.trial_will_end`
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

## Testing Subscriptions

Test subscription flows in development:
1. Use test API keys
2. Set shorter intervals for testing
3. Simulate payment failures
4. Test webhook integrations
