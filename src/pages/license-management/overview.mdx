# License Management

lomi. offers both an open-source solution and a hosted platform to cater to the diverse needs of our users. This section provides an overview of the licensing options available and how to manage them.

## Open Source

For users who prefer to self-host the lomi. platform, we provide an open-source version of our software. There is no need for license management when using the open-source version. Simply download the source code from our GitHub repository, install it on your own infrastructure, and start using lomi. without any restrictions.

While the open-source version provides a comprehensive set of features for payment orchestration, it may lack some of the advanced capabilities and support offered by our hosted platform. For a detailed comparison of the features available in each version, please refer to our [feature matrix](https://lomi.africa/feature-matrix).

Kindly note that the open-source version does not include payment channels; you'll need to implement them yourself by contacting each payment providers and sign a commmercial agreement to use their services.
