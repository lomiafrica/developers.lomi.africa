# Open Source Licensing

lomi. is committed to providing a powerful and accessible payment orchestration platform for everyone. As part of this commitment, our solution is entirely open-source and available on Github.

## We are here to help you make money

For regular merchants of our open-source version, there is no need to worry about this. You can simply start using lomi on our website without any restrictions and/or additional setup.

## Features and Limitations

While the open-source version of lomi. provides a comprehensive set of features for payment orchestration, it may lack some of the advanced capabilities and support offered in our hosted platform.

For a detailed comparison of the features available in each version, please refer to our [feature matrix](https://lomi.africa/feature-matrix).

## Going live by hosting the solution myself

If you would like to host the platform yourself, you can easily get started by cloning our main repo. However you'll have to get providers API keys by contacting them yourself.
