# Open Source Licensing

lomi. is committed to providing a powerful and accessible payment orchestration platform for everyone. As part of this commitment, we offer an open-source version of our platform under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## No License Management Required

For users of our open-source version, there is no need for any license management. You can simply download, install, and start using lomi. without any restrictions or additional setup.

## Features and Limitations

While the open-source version of lomi. provides a comprehensive set of features for payment orchestration, it may lack some of the advanced capabilities and support offered in our commercial plans.

For a detailed comparison of the features available in each version, please refer to our [feature matrix](https://lomi.africa/features).

## Upgrading to a Commercial Plan

If you find that your business requires more advanced features, dedicated support, or enterprise-grade capabilities, you can easily upgrade from the open-source version to one of our commercial plans.
