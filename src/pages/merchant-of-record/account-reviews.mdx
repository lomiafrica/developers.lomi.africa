# Account Reviews

As a Merchant of Record (MoR), we act as a reseller of merchants' goods and services. Therefore, we need to make sure that entrepreneurs and businesses using lomi. comply with our acceptable products & use policies. Combined with continuous monitoring, reviews and preventive actions to prevent fraud.

We strive to identify unacceptable use and take decisive actions to protect our infrastructure and merchants from incidents.

## Activation process (24-48h)

Every lomi. merchant will need to go through our a KYC/Activation process ahead of using our platform. We'll process this request within 24h (often faster). 

During this time, we'll perform the following checks:

- A quick survey about your business, products and intended use case with lomi.
- Identity verification (KYC) using passport (or drivers license) and selfie (soon); business registration documents and company/entrepreneur tax ID.

We need to perform this review on sign-up to ensure compliance with our acceptable products & use policy. Combined with meeting our own KYC/AML requirements as a payment platform operating in West Africa in accordance with the regulations defined by the BCEAO and the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire.

### Submit upfront and never worry again

We'll ask our merchants to submit those information upfront to speed up the the set-up of lomi. and enable merchants to enjoy all our products without concern of any issues or future delays.

## Continuous Reviews (Async)

We continuously monitor all transactions across our platform to proactively prevent fraud. In addition to performing asynchronous reviews of accounts at certain sale thresholds. These reviews are often completed within hours and without any additional information required from you.

You'll get notified over email that a review is taking place. Payouts will be paused during this time, but it has no impact on your customers' experience or ability to purchase, subscribe or checkout at any time.

We look at:
- Risk scores across historic transactions
- Refund & Chargeback ratio
- Appropriate next sales threshold for a review given the above

### High Chargeback Ratios

Credit card networks and mobile money providers consider 0.7% of sales in chargebacks excessive. Exceeding it can lead to monitoring programs with high costs, penalties and ultimately termination.

We therefore reach out proactively to collaborate on maintaining a low chargeback ratio and reducing it ahead of getting close to these thresholds.
