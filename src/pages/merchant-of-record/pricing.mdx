# Pricing
### Transparent fees at a 20% discount vs. competition

All transactions on lomi. come with a small fee of 4% + 0.5$/200XOF - applied to the entire transaction amount.

lomi. is built on top of multiple providers and banks, and we need to cover their fees with our rates. However, they impose a few additional fees for certain transactions that we need to pass on.

​
Additional Fees
+1% for international cards (non-US)
+0.5% for subscription payments
We also reserve the right to pass on any other fees our payment providers might impose in the future
Example

| Total Fees (Before Payout) | 1,210 XOF |

## Refunds

You can issue both full or partial refunds to your customers. However, the initial transaction fees are not refunded since payment providers charge them regardless of a future refund.

Please note: lomi. reserves the right to issue refunds at our own discretion up to 60 days after the purchase as part of our efforts to continuously and proactively reduce disputes & chargebacks which costs you 15$ (10.000 XOF) per dispute. We only leverage this right for this purpose and in the interest of reducing chargebacks and fees for you.

## Dispute/Chargeback Fees

Sometimes, customers can open a dispute/chargeback via their payment provider for a purchase. Disputes cost 10,000 XOF regardless of outcome and is deducted from your balance directly. This fee is charged by the underlying payment providers regardless of outcome and therefore something we cannot refund.

However, we continuously work to proactively reduce the rate of chargebacks across lomi. to be at or lower industry standards.

Payment providers impose monitoring programs, penalties and higher chargeback costs for sellers with high chargeback rates (~0.7%+). Since lomi. is the Merchant of Record, we therefore always monitor and proactively prevent our rate coming close to these thresholds.

Therefore, we might need to intervene and even suspend your account unless swift and proactive measures are taken to reduce chargebacks to an acceptable industry standard.

## Payout Fees

lomi. does not add any additional fees to payouts. All fees below are from the available payout providers and without any premium.

We offer manual withdrawals for merchants, keeping you in control of when to issue payouts.

Unless you have a lomi. balance that you haven't withdrawn for several months, at which point we'll eventually need to trigger a payout on your behalf.

### Standard Payouts
| Method | Fee | Processing Time |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| International Bank Transfer | 1.5% | 1-2 business days |
| Bank Transfer | Free | 1-2 business days |
| Mobile Money | 1.5% | Instant |
