# Manifesto

The time has come to transform payment processing across West Africa.

We believe that accepting payments shouldn't be complex, regardless of where you operate or what payment methods your customers prefer. The fragmented payment landscape creates unnecessary barriers and friction for businesses trying to grow.

lomi. addresses these challenges with an open approach to payment orchestration. We 
believe that:
- Every business, regardless of size, can easily and should sell online
- Merchants focus on growing their business, not wrestling with payment infrastructure
- Innovation in financial services must be accessible to all
- Payment solutions must be built by and for our local ecosystem

### Our Principles

To achieve this vision, we've built lomi. on these foundational principles:

**Merchant First**
- Your success is our success
- Every feature we build solves a real merchant need
- Pricing is transparent and fair
- Your feedbacks drives our roadmap

**Local Context Matters**
- Built specifically for West African markets
- Deep understanding of local payment behaviors
- Adapted to local infrastructure realities
- Partnerships with key regional players

**Community Driven**
- Open source is more than code sharing
- Community contributions are valued and recognized
- Knowledge sharing is essential

**Long-term Commitment**
- Building sustainable payment infrastructure
- Investing in the local tech ecosystem
- Growing with our merchants
- Continuous innovation and improvement

Join us in our mission to simplify payment processing across West Africa.

### Open Source

We believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and collaboration. By making our platform open source, we:

- Foster transparency and trust with our merchants and partners
- Encourage community contributions to continuously enhance the platform
- Enable developers to extend and customize lomi. to suit their unique needs
