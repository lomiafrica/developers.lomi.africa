# **Manifesto**

The time has come to open source payment processing across West Africa.

We believe that accepting payments shouldn't be complex, regardless of where you operate or what payment methods your customers prefer. The fragmented payment landscape creates unnecessary barriers and friction for businesses trying to grow beyond country borders.

lomi. addresses these challenges with a new approach to payment orchestration.

We believe that:
- Every business, regardless of its size, should easily be able to sell online with minimum code
- Merchants should focus on growing their business, not wrestling with payment infrastructure
- Innovation in financial services must be accessible to all
- Payment solutions must be built by and for our local ecosystem

### **Our principles**

To achieve this vision, we've built lomi. on these foundational principles:

**Merchant first**
- Your success is our success
- Every feature we build solves one of your needs
- Pricing is transparent and fair
- Your feedback drives our roadmap

**Local context matters**
- Built specifically for West African markets starting with Côte d'Ivoire and Sénégal
- Striving to deeply understand local payment behaviors and adapt to local realities
- Partnerships with key regional players

**Community driven**
- Open source is more than just code sharing
- Community contributions are valued and recognized
- Knowledge sharing is essential

**Long-term commitment**
- Building a sustainable payment infrastructure
- Giving back to the local tech ecosystem
- Growing with our merchants
- Continuous innovation and improvement

Join us in our mission to simplify payment processing and to be a foundational platform powering seamless payments for ventures across West Africa.

### **Open Source**

We believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and collaboration. By making our platform open source, we aim to:

- Foster transparency and trust with our merchants and partners
- Encourage community contributions to continuously enhance the platform
- Enable developers to extend and customize lomi. to suit their unique needs
- Enable anyone to self-host lomi. for their unique use-case
