# **Manifesto**

The time has come to open-source payment processing (and software in general) across West Africa.

We believe that accepting payments shouldn't be complex, regardless of where you operate or what payment methods your customers prefer. The fragmented payment landscape of our region creates unnecessary barriers and friction for businesses trying to grow beyond country borders and we aim to address these challenges with a new approach to payment orchestration.

We believe that:
- Every business, regardless of its size, should easily be able to sell online with minimum code and technical/administrative burden.
- Merchants should focus on growing their business, not wrestling with payment providers.
- Innovation in financial services must be accessible to all.
- Payment solutions must be built by and for local ecosystems.

## **Our principles**

To achieve this vision, we've built lomi. on these foundational principles:

### **Merchant first — always**
- Your success is our success.
- Every feature we build solves one of your needs.
- Pricing is transparent, fair, and cheaper than the competition.
- Your feedback drives our roadmap.

### **Local context matters**
- We build specifically for West African markets, starting with Côte d'Ivoire and Sénégal.
- We strive to listen, to deeply understand local payment behaviors, and adapt to local realities.
- We work on respecting the partners that trust us and regulators, with a high level of execution and integrity.

### **Community matters**
- Open source is more than just code sharing; it is a mindset, and it is in our blood.
- Community contributions are welcome, valued, and recognized.
- Knowledge sharing is essential.

## **Our long-term commitments**
- Building a secure, compliant, and sustainable payment infrastructure.
- Giving back to the local tech ecosystem.
- Growing with our merchants.
- Continuous innovation and improvement.

Join us in our mission to simplify payment processing and to be the foundational platform powering seamless payments for ventures across West Africa by 2030.

### **Being Open Source**

We believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and collaboration. By making our platform open source, we aim to:

- Foster transparency and trust with our merchants and partners.
- Encourage community contributions to continuously enhance the platform.
- Enable developers to extend and customize lomi. to suit their unique needs.
- Enable anyone to self-host lomi. for their unique use-case and give back to the community if they wish to.
