# **What is lomi.?**

lomi. is a unified, open-source payment orchestration platform built for West African merchants. We seamlessly integrate multiple payment providers and methods while providing a comprehensive set of e-commerce products.

Our platform empowers businesses to focus on growth without worrying about the challenges of payment processing and billing.

We aim to solve two core challenges:

### **Payment complexity**

The West African payment landscape is fragmented, with numerous payment providers and methods. This complexity often forces merchants to manage integrations themselves or rely on closed-source payment providers, leading to increased development and transaction costs, maintenance overhead, and technical debt.

lomi. solves this by providing:

- **Unified Integration**: One integration for all your preferred payment channels (Credit cards, MTN 'Momo', Wave, cryptocurrencies, Orange Money — and more integration coming soon!)
- **Customizable Checkout**: Highly customizable, seamless checkout experiences to boost conversion
- **Enterprise grade Analytics**: Gain valuable insights through detailed transaction reporting
- **Simple Reconciliation**: Streamlined reconciliation and refund processes
- **Powerful Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for business management

### **Lack of transparency**

The financial technology landscape in West Africa has historically suffered from opacity in operations, hidden fees, and limited visibility into transaction processing. Many merchants struggle with black-box payment processors that provide little insight into how their money moves.

lomi addresses this through:

- **Complete visibility**: Full transparency into transaction flows, fee structures, and processing status
- **Open Source architecture**: Our entire codebase is public, allowing anyone to review, audit, and contribute
- **Community governance**: Transparent decision-making process with merchant input on feature prioritization
- **Built-in compliance**:
  - Licensed payment service provider from the BCEAO (Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest)
  - Regular security updates and compliance monitoring

The platform is designed with security-first principles, ensuring that both merchants and their customers can transact with confidence.
