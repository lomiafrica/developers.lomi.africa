# **Authenticate**

The `lomi. login` command authenticates the **lomi. CLI**, allowing it to securely interact with the **lomi. API** on your behalf using a dedicated **CLI Token**. This authentication is a prerequisite for most commands that require API access (like `status`, `payments`, `webhook`, and `dev`).

## **Usage**

```bash filename="Terminal"
lomi. login
```

## **How it works**

This command uses a secure **Device Authorization Grant** flow (a standard OAuth 2.0 flow designed for input-constrained devices like CLIs):

1.  **Initiation**: The CLI contacts the **lomi.** authentication service to start the login process.
2.  **Device Code Request**: The service generates a unique `user_code` (which you'll enter in the browser) and a `device_code` (used internally by the CLI to check for completion).
3.  **User Interaction**:
    *   The CLI displays the `user_code` for you to copy.
    *   It prompts you to press Enter, after which it attempts to open your default web browser to the **lomi.** `verification_uri`.
    *   In the browser, you log in to your **lomi.** account (if not already logged in) and enter the `user_code` when prompted to authorize the CLI.
4.  **Polling**: While you are authenticating in the browser, the CLI periodically polls the authentication service using the `device_code` to check if the authorization has been granted.
5.  **Token Retrieval**: Once you successfully approve the authorization in the browser, the authentication service provides a secure, short-lived **CLI Token** to the waiting CLI.
6.  **Secure Storage**: The CLI saves this **CLI Token** securely in the global configuration file (typically `~/.lomi/config.json`). This token is used for subsequent API calls made *by the CLI itself*.

  This device flow avoids the need for you to manually handle or store your main `LOMI_API_KEY` for general CLI operations, enhancing the security of your primary credentials.

## **Output example**

Upon successful login, you will see a confirmation message:

```text filename="Terminal output example"
Login initiated.

Action Required to complete authentication:

1. Copy this code: XXXX-XXXX

2. Press enter to open your browser

3. Paste the code when prompted on the webpage.

IMPORTANT: After signing in, you might be redirected elsewhere...
Please manually navigate back to the verification URL: https://lomi.africa/verify

Press Enter to open the browser and continue...
Waiting for you to authorize in the browser...

Saving CLI Token... âœ“
Login successful! CLI Token saved globally.

You can now run lomi. CLI commands that require authentication.
Use `lomi. init` in your project directory to set up SDK-specific API keys.
```

## **Troubleshooting**

-   **Browser not opening**: If the browser doesn't open automatically, manually copy the `verification_uri` shown in the terminal and paste it into your browser's address bar.
-   **Code expired**: The `user_code` is time-sensitive. If it expires before you complete the authorization, simply run `lomi. login` again to get a new code.
-   **Access denied**: If you deny the authorization request in the browser, the CLI login will fail. Run `lomi. login` again if this was unintentional.
-   **Network errors**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as the CLI needs to communicate with the **lomi.** authentication service.
-   **Firewall issues**: If you are behind a strict firewall, ensure it allows HTTPS connections to `lomi.africa`. Check your firewall settings or contact your network administrator if you suspect issues.
