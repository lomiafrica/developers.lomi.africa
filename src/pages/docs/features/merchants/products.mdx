});
```

});
```

  product: "prod_123456789",
  currency: "XOF",
  type: "pay_what_you_want",
  minimum_amount: 1000, // Minimum amount in XOF
  suggested_amount: 5000 // Default amount shown
});
```

## Product Media

Add rich media to showcase your products:

```typescript
const product = await lomi.products.update("prod_123456789", {
  images: [
    "https://your-domain.com/image1.jpg",
    "https://your-domain.com/image2.jpg"
  ]
});
```

### Media Guidelines

- Maximum file size: 10MB per image
- Recommended size: 1200x630 pixels
- Up to 8 images per product

## Product Management

### List Products
```typescript
const products = await lomi.products.list({
  limit: 10,
  active: true
});
```

### Update Product
```typescript
const product = await lomi.products.update("prod_123456789", {
  name: "New Product Name",

});
```

For digital products with limited inventory:

```typescript
const product = await lomi.products.create({
  name: "Limited Edition Package",
  inventory: {
    type: "finite",
    quantity: 100,
    out_of_stock_behavior: "prevent_purchases"
  }
});
```
