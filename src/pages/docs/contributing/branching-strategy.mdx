# Branching Strategy

We follow a Git workflow inspired by GitFlow but simplified for continuous delivery and integration. This strategy ensures a stable production branch (`main`) while facilitating active development on the `develop` branch.

## Main branches

These are the long-lived core branches of the repository.

### `main` branch

- Represents the **production-ready** code. Only fully tested and approved code resides here.
- **Protected**: Direct pushes are disabled. Changes must come through reviewed Pull Requests from `release` or `hotfix` branches.
- **Tagged**: Each merge into `main` corresponds to a release and should be tagged with a semantic version number (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
- **Deployments**: Merges to `main` trigger automated deployments to the production environment.

### `develop` branch

- Serves as the primary **integration branch** for ongoing development.
- Contains the latest successfully built development code, including completed features and bug fixes awaiting release.
- **Protected**: Requires status checks (CI tests) to pass before merging.
- **Deployments**: Changes merged into `develop` are typically deployed automatically to a staging or pre-production environment for further testing.
- **Source for Features**: All feature branches should be created from `develop`.

## Feature development

Short-lived branches used for specific tasks.

### Feature branches (`feature/*`)

Used for developing new features.

```bash
# 1. Ensure your local develop is up-to-date
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# 2. Create your feature branch from develop
git checkout -b feature/payment-method-wave

# 3. Work on your feature, commit changes regularly
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat(payments): implement initial Wave structure"

# 4. Keep your branch updated with develop (optional but recommended)
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/develop

# 5. Push your feature branch to your fork
git push origin feature/payment-method-wave
```

### Bug fix branches (`fix/*`)

Used for fixing non-critical bugs discovered during development.

```bash
# 1. Create bug fix branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b fix/transaction-timeout-handling

# 2. Fix the bug and commit
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "fix(transactions): increase timeout and add retry logic"

# 3. Push the branch
git push origin fix/transaction-timeout-handling
```

## Release process

Managed branches for preparing and executing releases.

### Release branches (`release/*`)

Used to prepare a new production release. Allows for final testing, documentation updates, and minor bug fixes specific to the release.

```bash
# 1. Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# 2. Perform release tasks (e.g., bump version, update changelog)
npm version minor -m "chore(release): prepare release %s"
# ... final tests, documentation updates ...

# 3. Push the release branch (allows CI to run tests)
git push origin release/v1.2.0

# 4. Once ready, merge into main and develop, then tag main
# (See Merge Strategy below)
```

### Hotfix branches (`hotfix/*`)

Used for addressing critical bugs found in the production (`main`) branch. These require immediate attention.

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch directly from main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-auth-issue-1.2.1

# 2. Fix the critical bug
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve critical login vulnerability"

# 3. Bump the patch version
npm version patch -m "chore(release): hotfix %s"

# 4. Push the hotfix branch
git push origin hotfix/critical-auth-issue-1.2.1

# 5. Once fixed and tested, merge into main and develop, then tag main
# (See Merge Strategy below)
```

## Branch protection rules

Configured in the GitHub repository settings to enforce the workflow.

1.  **`main` Branch**
    - Require Pull Request reviews before merging (at least 1 approval).
    - Require status checks (CI tests, linting) to pass before merging.
    - Require branches to be up to date before merging.
    - **Disallow direct pushes.**
    - Enforce linear history (prefer squash or rebase merging for PRs).

2.  **`develop` Branch**
    - Require status checks to pass before merging.
    - Allow maintainers to merge without review (optional, based on team policy).
    - Prefer squash or rebase merging for feature PRs to keep history clean.

## Merge strategy

How branches are merged back into the main lines.

1.  **Feature/Fix branches to `develop`**
    - Create a Pull Request from your `feature/*` or `fix/*` branch targeting the `develop` branch.
    - Ensure CI checks pass and code review is complete (if required).
    - **Use Squash and Merge or Rebase and Merge** via the GitHub PR interface to maintain a clean `develop` history.
    - Delete the feature/fix branch after merging.

2.  **`release/*` Branch to `main` and `develop`**
    - Create a Pull Request from the `release/*` branch targeting `main`.
    - Ensure all final checks and approvals are met.
    - **Use Merge Commit (`--no-ff`)** to preserve the history of the release preparation.
    - After merging to `main`, **tag the merge commit** on `main` with the version number (e.g., `git tag v1.2.0 <main_merge_commit_hash>`). Push the tag (`git push upstream --tags`).
    - Create another Pull Request (or merge directly if permissions allow) from the `release/*` branch back into `develop` to incorporate any release-specific fixes made on the release branch.
    - Delete the release branch after merging into both `main` and `develop`.

3.  **`hotfix/*` Branch to `main` and `develop`**
    - Similar to releases: Create a PR targeting `main`, merge using Merge Commit (`--no-ff`), tag the merge commit on `main`, push the tag.
    - Create another PR (or merge directly) from the `hotfix/*` branch back into `develop` to ensure the fix is included in ongoing development.
    - Delete the hotfix branch after merging into both `main` and `develop`.

## Best practices summary

1.  **Branch naming conventions**
    - `feature/<description>`
    - `fix/<description>`
    - `release/v<version>`
    - `hotfix/<description-or-version>`
    - Use kebab-case (hyphen-separated) descriptions.

2.  **Commit messages**
    - Follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
    ```bash
    # Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    # Example: feat(payments): add Wave payment provider integration
    ```
    - Reference related issue numbers in the commit body or footer (e.g., `Closes #123`).

3.  **Pull requests**
    - Write clear, descriptive PR titles and descriptions.
    - Link to the relevant issue(s).
    - Keep PRs focused on a single logical change.
    - Request reviews from relevant team members or code owners.
