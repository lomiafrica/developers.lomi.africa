# **Code of conduct**

## **Our pledge**

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## **Our standards**

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## **Enforcement responsibilities**

Community leaders (e.g., project maintainers, moderators) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## **Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (e.g., GitHub repositories, Slack/Discord, mailing lists) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (e.g., using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, acting as an appointed representative at an event).

## **Enforcement process**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### **Enforcement actions**

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1.  **Correction**
    - **Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
    - **Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
    ```bash filename="Example Correction Message"
    # Example private message format
    "Your recent comment [link/context] was considered inappropriate under our Code of Conduct because [reason]. Please review the CoC and adjust your communication accordingly."
    ```

2.  **Warning**
    - **Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
    - **Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.
    ```bash filename="Example Warning Message"
    # Example warning format
    "This is a formal warning regarding your behavior [link/context]. Further violations of the Code of Conduct may result in temporary or permanent restrictions from the community."
    ```

3.  **Permanent ban**
    - **Community impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
    - **Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
    ```bash filename="Example Ban Notification"
    # Example ban notification
    "Due to repeated or severe violations of our Code of Conduct, your access to the lomi. community spaces has been permanently revoked."
    ```

## **Reporting guidelines**

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the community leaders as soon as possible.

### **1. Contact information**

Reports can be made via:

Please **do not** report CoC violations via public `GitHub` issues.
- **Discord**: Send a direct message to users with the `@Moderator` role in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/33syDfh9).
