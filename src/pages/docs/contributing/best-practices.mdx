# Best practices

Following these best practices helps maintain code quality, consistency, and security across the lomi. project.

## Code organization

*(Guidance on structuring code within packages, modules, and components will be added here. Maintain a clear separation of concerns.)*

## Security

Security is paramount. Follow these guidelines to protect user data and system integrity.

### 1. Environment variables

Never commit sensitive keys or secrets directly into the codebase. Use environment variables.

```bash
# .env.example - Provide a template for required variables
LOMI_API_KEY=
LOMI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
NODE_ENV=development

# .gitignore - Ensure local environment files are not tracked
.env
.env.local
*.log
```

Refer to the [API Environment documentation](../../developers-reference/api-environment) for managing API keys.

### 2. Sensitive data handling

Avoid logging sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or personal user data. If necessary, ensure it's properly redacted.

```typescript
// Example: Redact sensitive information in logs
const sanitizeData = (data: any) => {
  const masked = { ...data };
  // Define sensitive keys specific to your context
  const sensitiveKeys = ['apiKey', 'secretKey', 'password', 'authorization', 'phoneNumber'];
  sensitiveKeys.forEach(key => {
    if (masked[key]) masked[key] = '[REDACTED]';
  });
  return masked;
};
```

Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
Consider practices like [Webhook Signature Verification](../../developers-reference/webhook-signature-verification) to ensure data integrity.

## Testing

*(Details on testing strategies, frameworks (e.g., Jest, Vitest), and how to write and run tests for different parts of the monorepo will be added here. Aim for comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.)*

## Git workflow

Adhere to our established Git workflow for smooth collaboration.

### 1. Branch management

Keep feature branches focused on a single task and relatively short-lived. Regularly rebase with the `develop` branch.

```bash
# Create a focused feature branch
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b feature/add-wave-provider

# Work on the feature...

# Commit changes following guidelines
git commit -m "feat(payments): implement Wave provider"

# Push the branch
git push origin feature/add-wave-provider
```

See the full [Branching Strategy](./branching-strategy) for details.

### 2. Commit messages

Use conventional commit messages to provide clarity and enable automated changelog generation.

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
# Example types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
# Example scopes: payments, webhooks, api, auth, docs

feat(auth): add API key rotation endpoint
fix(webhook): handle signature verification errors gracefully
docs(api): update authentication guide example
```

## Documentation

Good documentation is essential for maintainability and collaboration.

### 1. Code comments

Use comments to explain *why* something is done, not *what* it does (the code should explain the what). Use JSDoc or TSDoc for functions and complex logic.

```typescript
/**
 * Processes a payment request using the specified provider.
 * Handles potential errors and ensures idempotency.
 * @param request - The payment request details.
 * @returns A promise resolving to the payment result.
 * @throws {ValidationError} If the request payload is invalid.
 * @throws {PaymentProcessingError} If the provider fails.
 */
async function processPayment(
  request: PaymentRequest
): Promise<PaymentResult> {
  // Implementation details...
}
```

### 2. README files

Ensure packages and significant components have README files explaining their purpose, usage, configuration, and how to run tests.

```markdown
# Package/Component Name

## Overview
A brief description of what this package/component does.

## Installation
`pnpm add @lomi/package-name`

## Usage
Provide clear code examples and instructions.

## Configuration
Detail any available configuration options.

## Testing
Explain how to run tests for this specific package/component.
`pnpm --filter @lomi/package-name test`
```

## Deployment

Follow standard procedures for deployment.

### 1. CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines automate testing and deployment. Ensure your changes pass all checks.

```yaml
# Example: .github/workflows/ci.yml (Simplified)
name: CI Checks
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8 # Specify pnpm version
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Specify Node.js version
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm lint
      - run: pnpm test
```

### 2. Version control

Package versions are managed within their respective `package.json` files and updated according to our [Versioning](./versioning) guide.

```json
// Example: packages/api/package.json
{
  "name": "@lomi/api",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18"
  },
  "main": "dist/index.js"
}
```
