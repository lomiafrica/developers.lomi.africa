# **Getting Started**

Ready to make your first contribution to lomi.? This guide will walk you through finding an issue, setting up your development environment, making changes, and submitting them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: For version control.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: We recommend the latest LTS version.
- **[bun](https://bun.sh/)**: Our preferred package manager for managing dependencies in the monorepo.

## 0. Find an issue to work on (optional, but recommended)

Before diving into code, it's helpful to find an existing issue or propose a new one:

- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./issues) on the main repository.
- Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` if you're new.
- If you have a new idea or bug fix, consider creating a new issue to discuss it first.
- Don't hesitate to ask questions in the issue comments if anything is unclear.

## 1. Fork the repository

Start by forking the main lomi. repository on GitHub:

1. Go to the [lomi. repository](https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi.).
2. Give us a star !
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.

## 2. Clone your fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beloved_anon/lomi.git
cd lomi.
```

Replace `<beloved_anon>` with you real GitHub username.

## 3. Set upstream remote

Add the original lomi. repository as the `upstream` remote. This allows you to keep your fork synchronized with the main project.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./
```

Verify the remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
# origin  https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/lomi./ (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/lomi./ (push)
# upstream https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./ (fetch)
# upstream https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./ (push)
```

## 4. Install dependencies & set up environment

Install the project dependencies using bun from the root of the monorepo:

```bash
bun install
```

Set up your local environment variables by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Review the .env file and add any necessary secrets or configurations
```

## 5. Local development commands

Here are some common commands you'll use during development:

```bash
# Start the main development server (specific app may vary)
# Check the package.json in the specific app/package directory
bun run dev

# Build and serve the documentation site locally
bun run docs:dev

# Run linting checks across the project
bun run lint

# Run linters and automatically fix issues
bun run lint:fix
```

## 6. Create a branch

Before making changes, create a new branch based on the `develop` branch. Follow our [Branching strategy](./branching-strategy) for naming conventions.

```bash
# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Check out the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Pull the latest changes for develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create your feature or bugfix branch
git checkout -b <BRANCH_TYPE>/<SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
# Example: git checkout -b feature/add-cool-new-thing
# Example: git checkout -b fix/resolve-that-bug
```

## 7. Make your changes

Now you can start making your code or documentation changes within the appropriate package or app in the `packages/` or `apps/` directory.

- **Code changes**: Write your code, ensuring it adheres to our [Code standards](#code-standards) and [Best practices](#best-practices).
- **Documentation changes**: Update or add documentation in the relevant `apps/developers/src/pages/docs/` directory. Use Markdown (`.mdx`).

**Keep your branch updated:**

Periodically, keep your branch up-to-date with the latest changes from the upstream `develop` branch:

```bash
# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch onto the latest develop branch
# Make sure you have committed or stashed your local changes first!
git rebase upstream/develop

# You might need to resolve conflicts during the rebase process.
# After resolving conflicts: git add . ; git rebase --continue
# If you get stuck: git rebase --abort
```

## 8. Test your changes

Ensure your changes pass all relevant tests and meet our quality standards.

```bash
# Example: Running tests for a specific package
# Replace <package_name> with the actual package, e.g., @lomi/api
bun --filter <package_name> test

# Run specific tests using a pattern (e.g., tests related to 'payment')
bun test -- --grep "payment"

# Run all tests across the monorepo
bun test

# Run tests and generate a coverage report
bun run test:coverage
```

Write tests for your changes. See the [Code standards](#code-standards) section for an example.

## 9. Commit your changes

Commit your changes using a descriptive message that follows our [Commit message guidelines](./branching-strategy#commit-messages). Adhering to the format helps automate releases and changelogs.

**Commit message format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

# Examples:
# feat(api): add support for webhook signature verification
# fix(docs): correct typo in getting started guide
# chore(deps): update dependency xyz
```

**Example commit:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(payments): implement new payment provider"
```

See [Best practices](#best-practices) for good vs. bad commit message examples.

## 10. Push your changes

Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin <BRANCH_NAME>
```

## 11. Submit a pull request (PR)

1.  Go to your fork on GitHub (`https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/lomi.`).
2.  You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch. Click "Compare & pull request".
3.  Ensure the base repository is `lomiafrica/lomi.` and the base branch is `develop`.
4.  The head repository should be your fork, and the compare branch should be your feature/fix branch.
5.  **Write a clear PR title:** Use the same format as commit messages (`<type>(<scope>): <description>`).
6.  **Fill out the PR template:** Provide a clear description of your changes, including:
    *   **Changes:** What did you change and why?
    *   **Testing:** How did you test your changes? (e.g., unit tests added, manual testing steps). Link to CI checks.
    *   **Related Issues:** Link any issues this PR resolves (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`).
7.  **Checklist before submitting:**
    *   [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project.
    *   [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code.
    *   [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.
    *   [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.
    *   [ ] My changes generate no new warnings.
    *   [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
    *   [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes (`bun test`).
    *   [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules.
    *   [ ] Commits are squashed appropriately (if needed) and have meaningful messages.
8.  Submit the Pull Request.

## Code standards

Maintain high code quality by following these standards:

### 1. TypeScript

Use TypeScript for type safety and clarity.

```typescript
// Good: Clear interface and types
interface PaymentRequest {
  amount: number; // Amount in smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)
  currency: string; // ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., 'XOF')
  providerCode: string; // Unique identifier for the payment provider
}

async function processPayment(request: PaymentRequest): Promise<PaymentResult> {
  // Implementation...
  // Use types for return values as well
}
```

### 2. Testing

Write meaningful tests using Vitest (`describe`, `it`, `expect`).

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { processPayment } from '../src/payment-processor'; // Adjust path

describe('Payment Processing', () => {
  it('should process a valid payment request', async () => {
    const request: PaymentRequest = {
      amount: 10000, // e.g., 100.00 XOF
      currency: 'XOF',
      providerCode: 'PROVIDER_X',
    };

    // Mock dependencies if necessary
    // vi.mock(...)

    const result = await processPayment(request);
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.status).toBe('completed');
    // Add more specific assertions
  });

  it('should throw validation error for invalid amount', async () => {
    const request: PaymentRequest = {
      amount: -500,
      currency: 'XOF',
      providerCode: 'PROVIDER_X',
    };

    await expect(processPayment(request)).rejects.toThrow(ValidationError);
  });
});
```

### 3. Documentation (TSDoc)

Document exported functions, classes, and types using TSDoc comments.

```typescript
/**
 * Processes a payment request using the specified provider.
 *
 * @param request - The payment request details.
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the payment result.
 * @throws {ValidationError} If the request data is invalid.
 * @throws {PaymentProviderError} If the payment provider encounters an error.
 * @throws {Error} For unexpected errors during processing.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await processPayment({ amount: 5000, currency: 'XOF', providerCode: 'WAVE' });
 * console.log(result.transactionId);
 * ```
 */
async function processPayment(request: PaymentRequest): Promise<PaymentResult> {
  // Validate input
  // Call provider-specific logic
  // Handle errors
  // Return result
}
```

## Best practices

Follow these best practices for maintainable and collaborative code.

### 1. Commit messages

Write clear, concise, and informative commit messages.

```bash
# Good: Specific type, scope, and description
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement API key generation endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(webhooks): handle duplicate event processing"
git commit -m "docs(contributing): clarify rebase workflow"

# Bad: Vague, uninformative
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "wip"
git commit -m "more changes"
```

### 2. Code style

Write clean, readable code. We use Prettier and ESLint for automatic formatting and linting (`bun run lint:fix`).

```typescript
// Good: Readable, consistent formatting, meaningful names
function isValidAmount(amount: number, maxAmount: number = 1000000): boolean {
  return amount > 0 && amount <= maxAmount;
}

// Bad: Poor formatting, short unclear names, magic numbers
function validate(a){return a>0&&a<=1000000}
```

### 3. Error handling

Handle errors gracefully and provide context.

```typescript
// Good: Catch specific errors, provide context, log appropriately
import { logger } from './logger'; // Assuming a logger utility

try {
  const result = await processPayment(request);
  logger.info({ transactionId: result.id }, 'Payment successful');
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    logger.warn({ error, request }, 'Invalid payment request');
    // Return specific error response to client
  } else if (error instanceof PaymentProviderError) {
    logger.error({ error, request }, 'Payment provider failed');
    // Handle provider-specific failure (e.g., retry logic, alert)
  } else {
    logger.error({ error, request }, 'Unexpected error during payment processing');
    // Handle unknown error
  }
}

// Bad: Ignores error, logs vaguely
try {
  await processPayment(request);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Something went wrong"); // Lacks context
}
```
