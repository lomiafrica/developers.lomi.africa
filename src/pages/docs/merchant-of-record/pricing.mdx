# **Pricing**

### **Transparent fees at a 20% discount vs. competition**

All transactions on lomi. come with a small fee of **3.2% + 200 XOF (+ $0.3)** applied to the entire transaction amount. There are no other transaction feesâ€”no subscription charges, no premium fees for WhatsApp communication, and no extra charges for regular payouts.  

lomi. is built on top of multiple providers and banks, and our rates cover their fees. However, they impose a few additional charges for certain transactions, which we need to pass on.  

### **Additional Fees**
- **+0.8% for international cards**  
- We reserve the right to pass on any other fees that our payment providers might impose in the future.

## **Refunds**  

You can issue both **full and partial refunds** to your customers. However, initial transaction fees are **non-refundable**, as payment providers charge them regardless of a future refund. Additionally, a **refund processing fee of 2%** applies to all refunded transactions.  

### Example Breakdown
For a **30,000 XOF** refund:  

| Item | Amount |  
|------|---------|  
| **Original Transaction Value** | 30,000 XOF |  
| **Transaction Fee (3.2% + 200 XOF)** | 1,060 XOF |  
| **Refund Processing Fee (2%)** | 600 XOF |  
| **Total Deductions** | 1,660 XOF |  
| **Final Refund Amount to Customer** | 28,340 XOF |  

**Please note:** lomi. reserves the right to issue refunds at our discretion **within 60 days** after a purchase. This helps proactively reduce disputes and chargebacks, which cost **$15 (10,000 XOF) per dispute**. We only exercise this right to minimize chargebacks and associated fees for you.

---

## **Disputes**

Sometimes, customers may dispute a transaction or request a chargeback via their payment provider. **Each dispute costs 10,000 XOF, regardless of the outcome**, and is deducted from your balance directly. This fee is charged by the underlying payment providers and **cannot be refunded**.  

Chargebacks are rare on mobile money transactions, but we work proactively to **meet global industry standards** and minimize disputes.  

**Important:**  
- Payment providers impose monitoring programs, penalties, and higher chargeback costs for sellers with high chargeback rates (~0.7%+).  
- Since lomi. is the **Merchant of Record**, we monitor and manage chargeback rates to prevent exceeding thresholds.  
- If chargebacks increase, we may need to intervene or suspend accounts unless proactive measures are taken.  

Before initiating a chargeback, **please email us first**â€”we're happy to resolve disputes directly with your merchant.
