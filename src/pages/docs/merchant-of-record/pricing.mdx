## **Refunds**

You can issue both full and partial refunds to your customers. However, initial transaction fees are non-refundable, as payment providers charge them regardless of any future refund. Additionally, a refund processing fee of 4% applies to all refunded transactions. In the case of a full refund, your customer will receive the full amount they paid—without any penalties, as the merchant absorbs the costs.

<InfoBox mini type="info" variant="blue">
    lomi. reserves the right to issue refunds at our discretion within 60 days of a purchase. This helps proactively reduce disputes and chargebacks, which cost $15 (10,000 XOF) per dispute, charged directly to the merchant. We only exercise this right to help minimize chargebacks, avoid unexpected charges, and reduce associated fees on your behalf.
</InfoBox>

## **Disputes**

Sometimes, customers may dispute a transaction or request a chargeback via their payment provider. **Each dispute costs 10,000 XOF, regardless of the outcome**, and is deducted from your balance directly. This fee is charged by the underlying payment providers and **cannot be refunded**.

Chargebacks are rare on mobile money transactions, but we work proactively to **meet global industry standards** and minimize and avoid disputes.

**Important:**
- Payment providers impose monitoring programs, penalties, and higher chargeback costs for sellers with high chargeback rates (~0.7%+).
- Since lomi. is the **Merchant of Record**, we monitor and manage chargeback rates to prevent exceeding thresholds.
- If chargebacks increase, we may need to intervene or suspend accounts unless proactive measures are taken.

Before initiating a chargeback, **please email us first**—we're happy to resolve disputes directly with your merchant.

## **Payout fees**

lomi. does **not** add extra fees to standard payouts. The fees below are set by payout providers. However, in some cases, for **fast payouts**, we charge an additional **2%**.

For **international bank transfers**, we charge **1% + $5.00 (or 3,500 XOF)** to cover our costs.

We offer both **manual and automatic withdrawals** for merchants, giving you full control over payouts. If you have a lomi. balance that remains unwithdrawn for several months, we may trigger a payout on your behalf.

### **Standard payouts**
| Method                        | Fee                      | Processing Time     |
