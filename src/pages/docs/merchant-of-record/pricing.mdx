## **Refunds**

You can issue both **full and partial refunds** to your customers. However, initial transaction fees are non-refundable, as payment providers charge them regardless of any future refund. Additionally, a refund processing fee of 4% applies to all refunded transactions. In the case of a full refund, your customer will receive the full amount they paid—without any penalties, as the merchant absorbs the costs.

    lomi. reserves the right to issue refunds at our discretion within 60 days of a purchase. This helps proactively reduce disputes and chargebacks, which cost **$15 (10,000 XOF)** per dispute, charged directly to the merchant. We only exercise this right to help minimize chargebacks, avoid unexpected charges, and reduce associated fees on your behalf.

## **Disputes**

Sometimes, customers may dispute a transaction or request a chargeback via their payment provider. **Each dispute costs 10,000 XOF, regardless of the outcome**, and is deducted from your balance directly. This fee is charged by the underlying payment providers and **cannot be refunded**.

Chargebacks are rare on mobile money transactions, but we work proactively to **meet global industry standards** and minimize and avoid disputes.

**Important:**
- Payment providers impose monitoring programs, penalties, and higher chargeback costs for sellers with high chargeback rates (~0.7%+).
- We monitor and manage chargeback rates to prevent exceeding problematic thresholds.
- If chargebacks increase, we may need to intervene or suspend accounts unless proactive measures are taken.

Before initiating a chargeback, **please email us first**—we're happy to resolve disputes directly with your merchant.
