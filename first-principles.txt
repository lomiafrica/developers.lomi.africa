# First Principles - Payment Orchestration Platform

## Core Problem Statement
Build a unified, scalable payment platform that integrates multiple providers, handles various payment methods, and provides a seamless experience for merchants and end-users.

## Key Objectives
- Simplify payment management for merchants
- Support multiple payment providers and methods
- Ensure secure, reliable, and performant payment processing
- Provide comprehensive reporting and analytics
- Offer customizable checkout experiences
- Implement fraud detection and prevention
- Support multi-currency transactions
- Ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS)

## Core Assumptions
1. Assumption: Selected technologies (TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, React, etc.) are the best fit
   Validation: Popularity and robustness for building scalable web applications

2. Assumption: Microservices architecture is optimal
   Validation: Suitable for complex platform with multiple integrations and scalability needs

3. Assumption: Outlined features meet merchant and end-user needs
   Validation: Requires user research and feedback

## Fundamental Truths
- Payments are complex, with many providers, methods, currencies, and regulations
- Merchants want simplicity in managing payments
- Security, reliability, and performance are critical
- Fraud detection and prevention are essential for a trusted platform
- Compliance with industry standards is mandatory

## Key Components
- Core payment processing and routing
- Integration with various payment providers (e.g., MTN, Wave, Orange Money and more)
- Merchant-facing features (dashboard, analytics, customization)
- End-user-facing features (checkout experience)
- Cross-cutting concerns (security, fraud detection, multi-currency support)
- Webhook management for real-time notifications
- Tokenization and secure data storage
- User management with role-based access control

## Ultimate Goal
Create a best-in-class payment orchestration platform that simplifies payment management for merchants, provides a great experience for their customers, and ensures the highest level of security, reliability, and compliance.

## Architecture
- Approach: Microservices
- Key Decisions:
  1. Decision: Use microservices over monolithic architecture
     Rationale: Better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability for complex platform with many integrations

  2. Decision: Use TypeScript over plain JavaScript
     Rationale: Static typing improves code quality, catches errors early, and facilitates refactoring

  3. Decision: Use FastAPI for individual services
     Rationale: FastAPI provides high performance, easy-to-use API development, and automatic API documentation

  4. Decision: Use Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication between services
     Rationale: Kafka enables reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant messaging between microservices

## Thought Experiments
1. Scenario: Adding a new payment method
   Approach: Modular microservices architecture and provider interfaces facilitate easy addition

2. Scenario: Handling a security breach
   Approach: Follow best practices, limit blast radius with microservices, have incident response plan

3. Scenario: Scaling to handle increased transaction volume
   Approach: Microservices architecture allows independent scaling of services, Kafka enables high-throughput processing

## Key Principles
- Modularity and extensibility
- Security by design
- Performance optimization
- Scalability
- User-centric approach
- Continuous iteration and improvement
- Compliance with industry standards
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Automated testing and deployment
- Clear documentation and knowledge sharing
